cycletimebystate
=========================

## Overview

This app uses the Rally analytics api, including the TimeInState calculator, to create cycle time metrics (in days) for different fields and field states. For example it could be used to show the average time spent in each of your kanban states. It also provides some basic pivot table functionality to allow you to explore the metrics based on story/defect size, team, month etc.
